# android-mvi-sample
Example MVI implementation, based off of Google's architectural samples.

## Description
This is a sample implementation of the Model View Intent pattern. Full Android examples for 
MVI are hard to find. It's a pattern that has seen wide adoption in the Javascript and .NET world.
Target audience include, but not limited to:

- Developers making the pivot from an imperative to declarative style of programming.
- Developers looking for best-practices in functional or reactive programming on Android.

Here are some articles/examples explaining the core principles of MVI and unidirectional flow:
